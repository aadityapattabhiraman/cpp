### Functions

A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.  
A function call tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. The CPU essentially “puts a bookmark” at the current point of execution, executes the function named in the function call, and then returns to the point it bookmarked and resumes execution.  
A function whose definition is placed inside another function is a nested function. Unlike some other programming languages, in C++, functions cannot be nested.
